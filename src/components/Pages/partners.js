                  Relationships are essential to our mental health, especially
                  the one we have with ourselves. Healthy, supportive
                  connections increase a person's likelihood of happiness and
                  health.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Building and sustaining strong relationships with others can
                  help people overcome loneliness and deal with mental health
                  problems like anxiety and depression.

                  Let's start with you because it's important to remember and
                  take care of your relationship with yourself.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The way we view ourselves and how highly we value ourselves
                  has an impact on how well we take care of ourselves and how
                  resilient we may become.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Fortunately, there are several simple things we can do to
                  raise our self-esteem, such as thinking positively.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Our thoughts are frequently automatic and go unnoticed, but
                  being aware of them and determining whether they are pleasant
                  or negative may be really beneficial.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Try confronting your negative or unproductive thoughts and
                  shifting to a more constructive frame of mind. It can
                  significantly boost self-assurance.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Finding neutral alternatives could feel more realistic than
                  thinking only optimistically all the time. An example of a
                  negative mindset is, "I had a lot of things to do, yet I did
                  nothing. One that is impartial or realistic, such as: "Not
                  every day can be good, but that's OK because I can try again
                  tomorrow," can be substituted with "I'm useless."
                </li>
                <li>
                  Having a more objective perspective can eventually help you
                  develop a healthier and more fulfilling connection with
                  yourself.

                  To establish and maintain healthy relationships, we must put
                  out effort. Having open and honest interactions as well as
                  showing respect for and supporting others are essential

                  Being able to express yourself honestly and then listening to

                  Relationships can be impacted by life's obstacles because
                  sometimes we experience uncomfortable emotions that pile up
                  and make us irritated, abrupt, or retreat.

                <li>
                  Being open and honest can support you and others around you

                <li>
                  It can be difficult or unpleasant for you if someone you love

                  to help them in ways that also safeguard your mental health.

                  Here are three quick steps you can take to ensure that you're

                  <li>
                    <strong>‚ñ∂Ô∏è Set boundaries </strong>
                    Think about what you feel able to help with. Try to stick
                    with this - whether it's listening or offering practical
                    help like doing the shopping.
                  </li>
                  <li>

                    Find time to do something just for yourself. Try to focus on
                    your own hobbies and interests.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>üì£ Talk to someone you trust </strong>

                  Sometimes, we have strong feelings about something, think we
                  know what someone else thinks, or let our past affect what is
                  happening in the present. It can help to take a step back and
                  ask yourself the following questions:
                  <li>üî•What meaning have I given this situation?</li>
                  <li>

                  Working through these questions with those involved might help
